## Overview
We learn to edit face image with a deep network. Our network SC-FEGAN is well suited to generate high quality synthetic image using intuitive user inputs with sketch and color. We used SN-patchGAN discriminator and Unet-like generator with gated convolutional layers.

## Dependencies
- tensorflow
- numpy
- Python3
- PyQt5
- opencv-python
- pyyaml

## Usage
First, download the model from [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VPsYuIK_DY3Gw07LEjUhg2LwbEDlFpq1).

Basic usage is:
  ```
  mv /${HOME}/SC-FEGAN.ckpt.* /${HOME}/ckpt/
  python3 demo.py
  ```
  
Select the number of GPU by editing `demo.yaml` file (not support multi-GPUs).
  ```
  GPU_NUM: 1 (the number you want to use)
  #GPU_NUM: (if you want to use only CPU, erase the number)
  ```
  
You can use our network with simple GUI. The only erased regions are filled.

The buttons in GUI:

- `Open Image`: Open the image you want to edit and reset sketch and color.
- `Mask`: Click this button and draw the mask on the left viewer.
- `Sketches`: Click this button and draw the line for sketch on the left viewer.
- `Color`: Click this button and draw the line for color. If you click this first time, you have to choose the color from palette.
- `Palette`: Click this button to change color. If you choose the color, then click the `Color` button to change.
- `Save Img`: Click this button to save results. It is saved as '*name.jpg*'.
- `Arrange`: Arrange the editing works.
- `Undo`: Undo previous editing work.
- `Complete`: Complete the image and show it on the right.

  
We recommend using this in the following steps:
  ```
  1. Draw the sketch plausibly referring to the original image.
  2. Draw the mask on the sketched region.
  3. Click the `Arrange` button.
  4. Draw the color on the masked region.
  5. Click `Complete'.
  ```
